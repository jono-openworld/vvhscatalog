            <p class="course-p"><b>Description:</b> Honors Algebra I is designed for any student desiring to take an advanced level  mathematics course and who wants to be prepared for AP Calculus and may have an interest in preparing for  a career in Mathematics, Science and/or Engineering. The student is prepared for the increased workload an  Honors course demands. He/She is challenged to exceed the standards of the Algebra I course in order to  prepare him/her for the rigor of more advanced classes such as AP Calculus. Throughout the course, the  student develops concepts, techniques and theory in greater depth than the Algebra I course. Both  acceleration and enrichment are integral components of the curriculum. This is the first course in the four year Honors/AP Program in Mathematics and carries a weighted grade. Other areas of study are global  processes, geometry, and data analysis and probability. There are four main differences between regular and  Honors (pre-AP) and that is (1) the sophistication of the response the teacher asks of students, (2) the rigor of  the work that is required, (3) the way the teacher assesses what is taught, and (4) the global connections that  reach beyond the boundaries of what is taught in the textbook. Literacy strategies are integrated throughout  the curriculum.

            <p class="course-p"><b>Description:</b> AP Computer science requires strong logical reasoning skills. It is recommended that  the student have successfully completed at least one honors math course. No prior experience with computer  programming is necessary. Special Requirements: Students must have access to a computer during out-of school hours, on which they can install software and complete course assignments. AP Computer Science A is  an introductory course equivalent to a first-semester college-level course in computer science. The course  emphasizes object-oriented programming methodology with a concentration on problem solving through the  design and implementation of appropriate algorithms and data structures. In the course, the student is  expected to code fluently in an object oriented paradigm using the programming language Java. The student is  expected to be familiar with and be able to use standard Java library classes from the AP Java subset. In  addition, the student should be able to read and understand a large program consisting of several classes and  interacting objects as well as read and understand a description of the design and development process  leading to such a program. Also emphasized throughout the course is the ability to recognize ethical and  social implications of computer use.
