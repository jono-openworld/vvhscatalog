The student uses lines, planes, polygons, circles, and three-dimensional figures for representing and solving a variety of problems. The student uses calculators, computers and software programs (e.g. Geometer’s Sketchpad, Cabri Geometry), construction tools (e.g. compass, protractor, straight edge), and graphing utilities as tools in problem solving. Other areas of study include global processes; algebra, functions, and graphs; and data analysis and probability. Literacy strategies are integrated throughout the curriculum.

    <p class="course-p">Prerequisites: AP Calculus AB
    </p>
    <p class="course-p">Description: AP Calculus BC extends the concepts of limits, differentiation, and integration studied in AP Calculus AB to include sequences, infinite series, and parametric, polar and vector valued functions. More attention is given to techniques of integration using parts, trigonometric substitution, partial fractions, and improper integrals. Optional topics include vector analysis, developed to study lines, planes and surfaces in 3-dimensional space and/or advanced problem-solving techniques used in major mathematics contests. The student develops ideas from analysis throughout AP Calculus BC. The course prepares the student for the BC level Advanced Placement Exam in Calculus and as a result includes an extensive review of relevant topics.
