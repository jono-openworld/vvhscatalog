The student also refines skills with group processes, such as decision-making, conflict resolution, and time management with respect to individual and staff deadlines and mentors less experienced staff members. The Yearbook II student is encouraged to assume increased responsibility and to develop skills that lead to editorial positions with mentoring and coaching from more experienced staff members and with guidance from the teacher/advisor. The student generates authentic work by producing a yearbook for the school and community.
            </p>
            <p class="course-p"><b>Notes:</b> This course satisfies the graduation requirement that a student must earn one (1) career cluster, workplace readiness or language credit. Yearbook II requires the student to spend time outside of class to work on the yearbook production process, editing copy and advertising, desktop publishing, and facilitating staff work within deadlines. The student is expected to participate in scholastic journalism conferences, competitions, and internships as approved by the teacher. Per Senate Bill 25 (March 2001), the student may earn an academic letter by meeting pre-established criteria.

            <p class="course-p"><b>Description:</b> In English 9, the student surveys the underpinning elements of various types of literature from around the world. The student recognizes and understands the concept of theme, explores various genre and the unique characteristics of each (e.g. the oral tradition, poetry, prose, fiction, non-fiction, drama, the novel) and reads numerous selections by a wide variety of authors. Regardless of approach(s) used, the student applies critical thinking skills through reading, speaking, viewing and listening strands of language arts, through writing and research (50% of the course), and through the use of technology as a learning tool.
