                <br> Honors Algebra I is designed for any student desiring to take an advanced level  mathematics course and who wants to be prepared for AP Calculus and may have an interest in preparing for  a career in Mathematics, Science and/or Engineering. The student is prepared for the increased workload an  Honors course demands. He/She is challenged to exceed the standards of the Algebra I course in order to  prepare him/her for the rigor of more advanced classes such as AP Calculus. Throughout the course, the  student develops concepts, techniques and theory in greater depth than the Algebra I course. Both  acceleration and enrichment are integral components of the curriculum. This is the first course in the four year Honors/AP Program in Mathematics and carries a weighted grade. Other areas of study are global  processes, geometry, and data analysis and probability. There are four main differences between regular and  Honors (pre-AP) and that is (1) the sophistication of the response the teacher asks of students, (2) the rigor of  the work that is required, (3) the way the teacher assesses what is taught, and (4) the global connections that  reach beyond the boundaries of what is taught in the textbook. Literacy strategies are integrated throughout  the curriculum.

                <br> In Transition to College Math the student approaches the basic concepts and  techniques from Algebra I and Geometry through numerical and computation in concrete problem settings.  Graphing is used to strengthen numerical intuition and to give concrete representation of functional  relationships. The goal is to increase the readiness of the student to do college-level work in mathematics,  and therefore, to open career options to him/her that might otherwise remain closed.

Statistical inference <br>This course uses an interactive data collection approach using the text and lessons as resources and  addresses the standards presented by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). The student applies their knowledge of algebra and geometry to linear transformation of data, conducting surveys, and  analyzing the results. The student builds their own studies using both proper and improper data analysis  techniques, critiques studies conducted by other students and entities, and makes suggested improvements.

                <br> AP Computer science requires strong logical reasoning skills. It is recommended that  the student have successfully completed at least one honors math course. No prior experience with computer  programming is necessary. Special Requirements: Students must have access to a computer during out-of school hours, on which they can install software and complete course assignments. AP Computer Science A is  an introductory course equivalent to a first-semester college-level course in computer science. The course  emphasizes object-oriented programming methodology with a concentration on problem solving through the  design and implementation of appropriate algorithms and data structures. In the course, the student is  expected to code fluently in an object oriented paradigm using the programming language Java. The student is  expected to be familiar with and be able to use standard Java library classes from the AP Java subset. In  addition, the student should be able to read and understand a large program consisting of several classes and  interacting objects as well as read and understand a description of the design and development process  leading to such a program. Also emphasized throughout the course is the ability to recognize ethical and  social implications of computer use.

                <br> Anatomy and Physiology is a survey course of study directed through the anatomical  and physiological systems of humans. This laboratory course* is designed for the student interested in health  occupations and in how the body works. The student explores the structure and function of systems and how each contributes to the complete homeostasis of the body, including integumentary, skeletal, muscular,  nervous, circulatory, digestive, renal, respiratory, and reproductive. The student also participates in the  examination of cells, histology, and basic chemistry as it applies to the study of physiology. Dissection is  required for the anatomy portion of the course. *Lab Courses: a minimum of 250 minutes per week of  directed class activity for 36 weeks, 40% of which must be lab oriented, for a total of 150 clock hours (90 hours of class plus 60 hours of lab) shall be required for one (1) unit of credit, excluding passing period.

                <br> This laboratory course is designed to be the equivalent of a college introductory  biology course taken by biology majors. It is an intense course of study stressing strong study skills, critical thinking skills, and time management skills. Topics of study include molecules, cells, heredity, evolution, organisms, populations, and ecology. Laboratory work is strongly emphasized, including DNA biotechnology,  biochemistry, and population dynamics. At the completion of this course, the student is strongly encouraged  to take the AP exam. The student who demonstrates sufficient qualification on this exam may receive college  level credit and advance to upper level coursework in biology at the college level. The student is expected to complete some course assignments outside the school year (i.e., summer).

                <br> This laboratory class* is designed to provide the student with the scientific principles, concepts and methodologies required to understand, identify, and analyze environmental problems both natural and man-made, and to examine alternative solutions for resolving and/or preventing them.  The course is interdisciplinary, covering topics in the fields of geology, biology, chemistry, geography, and physics. The student examines the following themes: science is a process; energy conversions underlies all ecological processes; the Earth itself is one interconnected system; humans alter natural systems; environmental problems have cultural and social contexts; and human survival depends on developing practices that will achieve sustainable systems.  The student is encouraged, but is not required, to take the AP exam at the end of the school year.

                <br> Great Books II is an elective course in which the student builds on literary analysis and  discussion skills from Great Books I in order to examine a wide variety of literature and relevant texts. The  student is expected to develop skills for an increasing leadership role during discussion and text selection as  well as to begin to examine sustained themes across increasingly more complicated texts. The student is also  encouraged to expand the definition of relevant text across cultures and nontraditional formats. The student  studies and considers a broad spectrum of themes and perspectives across a variety of traditional texts while  making connections between themselves, his/her peers, and society. Although there may be a wide variety of  supplemental and anticipatory activities, Great Books II combines Great Books materials and the Shared  Inquiry Method. The Great Books curriculum develops thinking and language together through interactive  learning; develops oral language and literacy through appropriately challenging learning; draws on literature  from many genres, time periods, and cultures; emphasizes writing as an essential way to develop, clarify, and  communicate ideas in persuasive, expository, literary, and expressive discourse; provides for literacy in all  forms of media, embeds skills instruction in meaningful learning; teaches the strategies necessary for  acquiring academic knowledge and attaining independence in learning; builds on the language, experiences,  strategies, and interest that the student brings to school; and develops student’s distinctive writing or  speaking voice.
