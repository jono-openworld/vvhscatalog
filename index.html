The student is prepared for the increased workload an  Honors course demands. He/She is challenged to exceed the standards of the Algebra I course in order to  prepare him/her for the rigor of more advanced classes such as AP Calculus. Throughout the course, the  student develops concepts, techniques and theory in greater depth than the Algebra I course. Both  acceleration and enrichment are integral components of the curriculum. This is the first course in the four year Honors/AP Program in Mathematics and carries a weighted grade. Other areas of study are global  processes, geometry, and data analysis and probability. There are four main differences between regular and  Honors (pre-AP) and that is (1) the sophistication of the response the teacher asks of students, (2) the rigor of  the work that is required, (3) the way the teacher assesses what is taught, and (4) the global connections that  reach beyond the boundaries of what is taught in the textbook. Literacy strategies are integrated throughout  the curriculum.

The student also participates in the  examination of cells, histology, and basic chemistry as it applies to the study of physiology. Dissection is  required for the anatomy portion of the course. *Lab Courses: a minimum of 250 minutes per week of  directed class activity for 36 weeks, 40% of which must be lab oriented, for a total of 150 clock hours (90 hours of class plus 60 hours of lab) shall be required for one (1) unit of credit, excluding passing period.

            <p class="course-p"><b>Description:</b> This laboratory course is designed to be the equivalent of a college introductory  biology course taken by biology majors. It is an intense course of study stressing strong study skills, critical thinking skills, and time management skills. Topics of study include molecules, cells, heredity, evolution, organisms, populations, and ecology. Laboratory work is strongly emphasized, including DNA biotechnology,  biochemistry, and population dynamics. At the completion of this course, the student is strongly encouraged  to take the AP exam. The student who demonstrates sufficient qualification on this exam may receive college  level credit and advance to upper level coursework in biology at the college level. The student is expected to complete some course assignments outside the school year (i.e., summer).
