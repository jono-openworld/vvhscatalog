            <p class="course-p"><b>Description:</b> This laboratory course is designed to be the equivalent of a college introductory  biology course taken by biology majors. It is an intense course of study stressing strong study skills, critical thinking skills, and time management skills. Topics of study include molecules, cells, heredity, evolution, organisms, populations, and ecology. Laboratory work is strongly emphasized, including DNA biotechnology,  biochemistry, and population dynamics. At the completion of this course, the student is strongly encouraged  to take the AP exam. The student who demonstrates sufficient qualification on this exam may receive college  level credit and advance to upper level coursework in biology at the college level. The student is expected to complete some course assignments outside the school year (i.e., summer). 
            </p>

            <p class="course-p"><b>Notes:</b> The College Board states that "The AP Biology course is designed to be taken by students after the successful completion of a first course in high school biology and one in high school chemistry as well."

            <p class="course-p"><b>Description:</b> This laboratory class* is designed to provide the student with the scientific principles, concepts and methodologies required to understand, identify, and analyze environmental problems both natural and man-made, and to examine alternative solutions for resolving and/or preventing them.  The course is interdisciplinary, covering topics in the fields of geology, biology, chemistry, geography, and physics. The student examines the following themes: science is a process; energy conversions underlies all ecological processes; the Earth itself is one interconnected system; humans alter natural systems; environmental problems have cultural and social contexts; and human survival depends on developing practices that will achieve sustainable systems.  The student is encouraged, but is not required, to take the AP exam at the end of the school year.  The student may be expected to complete some course assignments outside the school year (i.e., summer).
