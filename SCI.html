In addition, the student learns  how chemistry and Earth and space science are related by studying electromagnetic radiation, radioactivity,  the structure of the Earth, and the groundwater. Scientific thinking and practice (e.g., extensive laboratory  activities, critical thinking, problem solving), science and society, and literacy are integrated in all science courses.

This laboratory course* is designed for the student interested in health  occupations and in how the body works. The student explores the structure and function of systems and how each contributes to the complete homeostasis of the body, including integumentary, skeletal, muscular,  nervous, circulatory, digestive, renal, respiratory, and reproductive. The student also participates in the  examination of cells, histology, and basic chemistry as it applies to the study of physiology. Dissection is  required for the anatomy portion of the course. *Lab Courses: a minimum of 250 minutes per week of  directed class activity for 36 weeks, 40% of which must be lab oriented, for a total of 150 clock hours (90 hours of class plus 60 hours of lab) shall be required for one (1) unit of credit, excluding passing period.
