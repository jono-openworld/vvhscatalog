It provides preparation for all subsequent science courses including Advanced  Placement classes. The student investigates topics of study that include, but are not restricted to, principles of motion, gravitation, heat, light, sound, electricity and magnetism, forces of nature, plate tectonics, and cosmology. As appropriate these topics are examined at scales ranging from atomic to astronomical. The focus is on conceptual understanding and mathematical relationships and applications. Literacy strategies are integrated throughout the curriculum. ",Concurrent enrollment in Algebra II is recommended. ,desiree.sers@aps.edu,,

Topics covered include, but are not restricted to, cell structure and function, biochemistry, genetics, ecology, evolution, taxonomy, and certain aspects of earth science. Reading,  writing, and speaking strategies are integrated in the course.

It provides preparation for all subsequent science courses including Advanced Placement courses.  The student investigates substances and how they react with one another. Concepts of study include, but are  not limited to, scientific measurement, properties and structures of matter, atomic theory, classification and  periodic trends, bonding theory, chemical reactions (e.g., general types, acid/base, redox), rates, equilibrium,  stoichiometry, energy, (e.g., EMR, bonding), nuclear chemistry, and solubility. In addition, the student learns  how chemistry and Earth and space science are related by studying electromagnetic radiation, radioactivity,  the structure of the Earth, and the groundwater. Scientific thinking and practice (e.g., extensive laboratory  activities, critical thinking, problem solving), science and society, and literacy are integrated in all science courses. 
",It is strongly recommended that the student has successfully completed Algebra I prior to taking Chemistry I. This course meets college entrance requirements. ,desiree.sers@aps.edu,,
1/4/2023 13:58:50,SCI,AP Physics I,43171,1,N/A,Year,Yes,No,"11, 12",,"AP Physics I is an algebra-based, introductory college-level physics course that explores topics such as Newtonian mechanics (including rotational motion); work, energy, and power;  mechanical waves and sound; and introductory, simple circuits. Through inquiry-based learning, students  will develop scientific critical thinking and reasoning skills. 25% of the instructional time will be spent in the  hands-on laboratory work, with an emphasis on inquiry-based investigations that provide students with  opportunities to apply the science practices. No prior course work in physics is necessary.
","The students earn a weighted grade for this course. For students interested in careers in engineering or science, the recommended course of study is AP Physics I in junior year. Completion of Algebra I and Geometry with a B or higher is strongly recommended.
