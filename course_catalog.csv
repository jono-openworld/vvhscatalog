It provides preparation for all subsequent science courses including Advanced Placement courses.  The student investigates substances and how they react with one another. Concepts of study include, but are  not limited to, scientific measurement, properties and structures of matter, atomic theory, classification and  periodic trends, bonding theory, chemical reactions (e.g., general types, acid/base, redox), rates, equilibrium,  stoichiometry, energy, (e.g., EMR, bonding), nuclear chemistry, and solubility. In addition, the student learns  how chemistry and Earth and space science are related by studying electromagnetic radiation, radioactivity,  the structure of the Earth, and the groundwater. Scientific thinking and practice (e.g., extensive laboratory  activities, critical thinking, problem solving), science and society, and literacy are integrated in all science courses.

Through inquiry-based learning, students  will develop scientific critical thinking and reasoning skills. 25% of the instructional time will be spent in the  hands-on laboratory work, with an emphasis on inquiry-based investigations that provide students with  opportunities to apply the science practices. No prior course work in physics is necessary.
","The students earn a weighted grade for this course. For students interested in careers in engineering or science, the recommended course of study is AP Physics I in junior year. Completion of Algebra I and Geometry with a B or higher is strongly recommended.

This laboratory course* is designed for the student interested in health  occupations and in how the body works. The student explores the structure and function of systems and how each contributes to the complete homeostasis of the body, including integumentary, skeletal, muscular,  nervous, circulatory, digestive, renal, respiratory, and reproductive. The student also participates in the  examination of cells, histology, and basic chemistry as it applies to the study of physiology. Dissection is  required for the anatomy portion of the course. *Lab Courses: a minimum of 250 minutes per week of  directed class activity for 36 weeks, 40% of which must be lab oriented, for a total of 150 clock hours (90 hours of class plus 60 hours of lab) shall be required for one (1) unit of credit, excluding passing period.
