It provides preparation for all subsequent science courses including Advanced  Placement classes. The student investigates topics of study that include, but are not restricted to, principles of motion, gravitation, heat, light, sound, electricity and magnetism, forces of nature, plate tectonics, and cosmology. As appropriate these topics are examined at scales ranging from atomic to astronomical. The focus is on conceptual understanding and mathematical relationships and applications. Literacy strategies are integrated throughout the curriculum. ",Concurrent enrollment in Algebra II is recommended. ,desiree.sers@aps.edu,,

Topics covered include, but are not restricted to, cell structure and function, biochemistry, genetics, ecology, evolution, taxonomy, and certain aspects of earth science. Reading,  writing, and speaking strategies are integrated in the course.

1/4/2023 13:52:54,SCI,Chemistry I ,42111,1,N/A,Year,Yes,No,10,,"This laboratory course exceeds state standards and offers extended opportunities for  students. It provides preparation for all subsequent science courses including Advanced Placement courses.  The student investigates substances and how they react with one another. Concepts of study include, but are  not limited to, scientific measurement, properties and structures of matter, atomic theory, classification and  periodic trends, bonding theory, chemical reactions (e.g., general types, acid/base, redox), rates, equilibrium,  stoichiometry, energy, (e.g., EMR, bonding), nuclear chemistry, and solubility. In addition, the student learns  how chemistry and Earth and space science are related by studying electromagnetic radiation, radioactivity,  the structure of the Earth, and the groundwater. Scientific thinking and practice (e.g., extensive laboratory  activities, critical thinking, problem solving), science and society, and literacy are integrated in all science courses. 
",It is strongly recommended that the student has successfully completed Algebra I prior to taking Chemistry I. This course meets college entrance requirements. ,desiree.sers@aps.edu,,
