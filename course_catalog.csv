and integration studied in AP Calculus AB to include sequences, infinite
 series, and parametric, polar and vector valued functions. More 
attention is given to techniques of integration using parts, 
trigonometric substitution, partial fractions, and improper integrals. 
Optional topics include vector analysis, developed to study lines, 
planes and surfaces in 3-dimensional space and/or advanced 
problem-solving techniques used in major mathematics contests. The 
student develops ideas from analysis throughout AP Calculus BC. The 
course prepares the student for the BC level Advanced Placement Exam in 
Calculus and as a result includes an extensive review of relevant 
topics.
