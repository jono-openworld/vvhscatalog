2022-09-25-10-55-46-663,MTH,Honors Geometry,35080,1,Honors Algebra 1,Year,Yes,No,"9, 10","In Honors Geometry the student learns abstract and logical thinking through inductive and deductive reasoning. The student uses advanced concepts in lines, planes, polygons, circles, and three-dimensional figures for representing and solving a variety of problems. The student uses calculators, computers and software programs, construction tools (e.g. compass, protractor, straight edge), and graphing utilities as tools in problem solving. Other areas of study include global processes; algebraic concepts, functions, patterns and graphs; and data analysis and probability. The course also includes an in-depth coverage of some Honors Algebra II/Trigonometry topics. ",Literacy strategies are integrated throughout the curriculum. This course carries a weighted grade.

2022-09-25-10-58-53-906,ELA,Creating Writing I,64512,1,English 10,Year,Yes,Yes,"11, 12","In Creative Writing I, the student reads, analyzes, and discusses selected models of various American authors to gain a background for extensive original thought and writing. The student experiments with and creates working and showcase portfolios (traditional and/or electronic) representing best work in various genres (e.g., short stories, one-act plays, poetry, fiction, and nonfiction). As part of the creative process, the student identifies and concentrates on individual needs for vocabulary development, spelling, sentence structure, and revision and prepares free-lance work for submission to publishers. The student uses technology to support writing, research, and the procedures for submitting work for consideration to print and on-line literary magazines.",Some schools may publish a literary magazine in class.
11/7/2022 16:49:47,MTH,AP Calculus BC,38085,1,AP Calculus AB,Year,Yes,Yes,"9, 10, 12","AP Calculus BC extends the concepts of limits, differentiation, 
and integration studied in AP Calculus AB to include sequences, infinite
 series, and parametric, polar and vector valued functions. More 
attention is given to techniques of integration using parts, 
trigonometric substitution, partial fractions, and improper integrals. 
Optional topics include vector analysis, developed to study lines, 
planes and surfaces in 3-dimensional space and/or advanced 
problem-solving techniques used in major mathematics contests. The 
student develops ideas from analysis throughout AP Calculus BC. The 
course prepares the student for the BC level Advanced Placement Exam in 
Calculus and as a result includes an extensive review of relevant 
topics. 
    ","This course carries a weighted grade.
